# DATAMODEL

To create the datamodel, I worked with draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net/), I used this tool because is universally known and it's free

Also, I created this model but I didn't use it in the code itself, the way I aproached this was to merge everything in a single table to starting generating the reports
